Here are some useful features you could add to your Streamlit app for building and querying SQLite databases from CSVs and schemas:

1. **Schema File Upload**
   Allow users to upload a `.sql` file with schema instead of pasting text. This makes managing large schemas easier.

2. **CSV Preview & Validation**
   Show a preview of each uploaded CSV and validate columns against the schema before inserting, to catch errors early.

5. **Download Database File**
   Provide a download button for the created SQLite `.db` file to export the current state.

Refresh button clears all uploaded files and resets the app state.

7.  **Schema Visualization**
    Automatically generate ER diagrams from the uploaded schema for better understanding.
